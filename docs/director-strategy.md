# Director Strategy — GEO Studio Product Roadmap

This file is the Director's long-term memory. Read it at the start of every
session. Update it when a horizon shifts or a decision changes the roadmap.

## Product mission

GEO Studio helps brands understand and improve how they appear in AI-generated
answers. The product measures visibility in LLM responses (Gemini and others),
scores it, tracks it over time, and turns the data into actionable
recommendations.

This is a private-beta SaaS tool. The priority is a working core loop — not
feature breadth.

---

## Three horizons

### H1 — Now: core loop must work end to end

The core loop is the minimum viable product. Every other priority is blocked
until H1 is clean.

```
Registro / Login
→ Nuevo dominio
→ Competitors suggested by the system (Gemini-backed)
→ Prompts suggested by the system (Gemini-backed)
→ Primer escaneo Gemini
→ Scan exits pending → done (not stuck)
→ Overview renders real scan data
→ Prompts / Competitors / Recommendations / Escaneos (all with real data)
```

**Current H1 status (updated 2026-06-05):**
- Wizard UX (2-column, auto-suggestions): working
- Competitor suggestions via Gemini: working (after model pin fix)
- Prompt suggestions via Gemini: working
- Scan stuck in pending: BLOCKER — stuck scans from before the `maxDuration=60`
  fix remain unresolvable without a cancel-scan action
- Overview with real data: unverified — depends on scan completing
- Gemini model pinned: `gemini-2.0-flash-001` (see ADR 0002)
- Vercel `maxDuration=60` on scan route (see ADR 0003)

**Next H1 actions (in priority order):**
1. Cancel-scan action for stuck runs (P0 blocker for launch)
2. Verify full scan → Overview data flow end to end
3. UX baseline pass aligned to GEO Suite design reference

### H2 — Next: GEO product differentiators

Work here only after H1 is clean and smoke-tested.

- Visibility scoring: composite metric (mention rate, share of voice, sentiment,
  citations) documented and computed from real data
- Temporal comparison: visibility trend over scans
- Actionable recommendations: generated from real scan deltas, not filler
- Share of voice per competitor
- Prompt performance breakdown

Owner of methodology: `geo-strategy` agent. Do not implement H2 features
without a GEO Strategy consultation.

### H3 — Future: platform

Work here only after H2 has real data and a validated scoring model.

- Multi-user / teams / RBAC
- Email alerts on visibility changes
- Public API
- Integrations (Slack, etc.)
- Billing / plans

These are explicitly **forbidden** to implement without a dedicated phase
approval (they appear in `CLAUDE.md`'s Forbidden list).

## Planned phase — ASYNC-SCAN-1 (not started, not approved)

**Origin:** while testing the redesigned add-domain wizard (PR #41), the
founder asked whether scan launch could be made asynchronous so the user lands
immediately on Escaneos and gets a bell notification when the scan finishes,
instead of waiting through the synchronous 30-90s scan inside `createProject`
(current mitigation: a loading overlay, shipped in PR #41).

**Why this is a phase, not a patch:** async execution means reopening
ADR-0003 (which currently mandates sync execution + `maxDuration=60` for the
private beta and explicitly marks async as "forbidden without explicit phase
approval"), plus a notifications system — new schema, new RLS policies, a
background-execution mechanism (`CLAUDE.md` lists "background scheduler" as
forbidden without approval). None of this should be implemented piecemeal.

**Why it is also necessary, not optional:** the founder confirmed that
**daily/scheduled scans** are on the roadmap. Scheduled scans are async by
definition — there is no user request to hang a synchronous call off of, so
the system needs a scheduler, background scan execution, and a way to tell the
user something finished without them asking. That is the *same*
infrastructure this phase would build for the manual "create domain" flow,
just with a different trigger (cron vs. user click).

**Recommendation:** design once for both triggers (manual launch +
scheduled/daily) rather than building the async pipeline twice. Before any
code: a Task Intake Report consulting `reliability` (async scan lifecycle,
retries, timeout handling without a synchronous request to anchor to) and
`platform-deploy` (which background-execution mechanism is viable on Vercel
without adding paid infra — `waitUntil`, Vercel Cron, external queue, etc.).
This phase is **gated on explicit founder approval** before any implementation
starts (schema + RLS + background scheduler are all in the Forbidden list).

## Product principles

1. **No fake progress.** Every metric, suggestion, and recommendation must trace
   to real persisted data. If data is insufficient, show an explicit empty state.
2. **Core flow first.** A broken H1 is the only P0. Visual polish is P2/P3.
3. **Small, reversible PRs.** One concern per PR. Human Gate before merge.
4. **Methodology before metrics.** The `geo-strategy` agent defines what to
   measure before the pipeline measures it.

## Active work (2026-06-05)

| Branch | Status | Next action |
|---|---|---|
| `claude/geo-studio-ux-audit-VHGBS` | Active (PR #18) | Smoke test pending |
| `feature/data-mgmt-1-delete-archived-projects` | Ready for PR | Claude QA + Human Gate |
| `feature/test-1-core-unit-tests` | Ready for PR | Merge with data-mgmt branch or separately |
| `chore/agents-restructure-1a` | In progress | This PR |

---

## QA execution model

Claude QA is run by the `qa` specialist subagent (`.claude/agents/qa.md`),
invoked by the Director from the main session. **GitHub Actions and the
Anthropic API key are NOT used for QA.** The `scripts/run-claude-qa.py` script
and `.github/workflows/claude-qa.yml` are superseded.

---

## Completed phases

- `UX-ALIGN-1`: guided onboarding wizard
- `UX-ALIGN-2A`: Escaneos as operational hub
- `AGENTIC-3`: GitHub-centered handoff workflow
- `AGENTIC-4`: PR handoff comments
- `AGENTIC-5B`: real Claude QA execution from PR handoff
- `DATA-MGMT-1`: hard delete of archived projects
- `TEST-1`: Vitest unit tests for parsers + delete action + delete button
- `AGENTS-RESTRUCTURE-1A`: this document (multi-file agent architecture)

## Design reference

`GEO Suite-2.zip` is the UX/UI source of truth. Location: `docs/design-reference/`.
Do not rename GEO Studio to Lumira (prototype name in some reference files).
